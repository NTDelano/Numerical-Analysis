The content we have been going over has come very easy to me as it is basically a throwback to linear algebra, which I am sure a lot of people remeber bits and pieces of. And it wasn't just me who was quiet. My whole group was pretty quiet as we really had little to no questions that realy challenged us to engage in a tough discussion, which i think is a shame. However, on Monday Avi talked with us for a bit about some programs he wrote and posted involving matrices. He went through the deifferent features of work, which he said he got through pretty quick, but only took a long time bacause he added all the color and design elements, which I thought was pretty funny. Othere than that, this week was a bit dull for our group."

Ever since changing groups, it just seems like I don't have the motivation to really engage in some conversations about the topics we learned. Really all I did was tended to talk about unrelated things, which is counter-productive. I was doing so good a while back, so I really need to get back to how I was. I need to be fully prepared, and make sure to list any questions I have. I have to try and figure out ways of using group time much more productively. Hence, increasing productivity in group time is my goal for next week."
