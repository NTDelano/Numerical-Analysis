    "One thing I have been really wanting to examine is the similarities between lagrange interpolation and divided differences. So I decided for one of my problems, I wanted to prove that they both come up with the same results. Divided differences finds a more discrete polynomial as it solves for a function significantly faster. However, if you were to add points, you would have to do the process of finding a poly. from scratch. Lagrange is better for larger data sets and dealing with more thoretical uses of interpolation, such as when we were doing image repair, which contains hundreds of nodes. I don't know about you, but divided difference would be significantly tougher to use.\n",

For now lets say we have $N=4$, such that $C$ can be divided up, and each key can help achieve the code we are encrypting. Once we have the number of keys, we can select a number, $k$, which represents the number of keys needed in order to decrypt the message. Therefore, if we have fewer than $k$ keys, then we will not be able to crack the code. Now that we know $k$, we can create a polynomial that can contain all the keys needed to crack the code. However, there is a catch. Say we are dealing with a linear function. We can't solve the function with only one point as that one point has an infinite amount of functions that pass through it. So we need at least two points to find said function. Similarly with quadratic functions, we have too many possible solutions if we have only one or two points (could pass through two points, but the line in between could be a max or min). Therefore, 3 points is probably the minimum we need to crack the code. One pattern that can be noticed is that when $k=2$, or 2 keys are needed, it is for a linear function, or a polynomial of degree 1. For quadratic, it is $k=3$.

    "As implied by the title, this check-in is to help catch me up from last week and this week, hence why there is a lot more content. But besides that, I feel I contributed to my group by my ability to keep on top of the lectures and understanding what they are trying to convey. There were many instances, such as when we got into the error of interpolation, where I had to help teach my group the topic we were meeting up for as some were falling behind, which is understanable as I have been doing the same thing. However, I really do enjoy the lectures, so I am usually on top of it. But questions arose, like where did h come from in error bounds, or personal preference between lagrange and divided differences in finding polynomials (which there is no real difference, other than Lagrange is a bit messier, making divided differences better for doing the process by hand). That was the summary of what I did these few weeks. Basically just answered questions based on my understanding of the notes as I tend to write pretty good notes when it comes to lectures."

    "I know in the past few check ins, my goals have been centered around exploring topics that relate to what we learn, such as other similar algorithms or applications. This week I really had fun in discovering interpolation application in cryptography as I am deeply in love with that field. Making that discovery really open my eyes as to what numerical analysis has to offer in the world of mathematics. I am sure there are plenty of concepts I haven't even scratch surface on, but I hope to continue finding newer and cooler applications of what we have been learning, especially if they have applications to cryptography or number theory. But besides that, I know one of my first goals was to really improve on my Latex writing skills. They have definetly improved, but I can see that my work can get messy at times and programming the functions in can be very time consuming. So I want to try and find more efficient methods of writing Latex so I am not spending countless hours writing it up for questions I have alreaady solved on paper."
