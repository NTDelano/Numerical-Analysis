    "I am very proud of my work from this problem due to the fact I was stupid about instantly simplifying the constants. It has become a habit due to calculus and algebra to try and simpify the problem so it easier to read and present. But by doing that in the case of taylor polynomials, it completely ruins the process of finding a general form as the constants we crossed out were important in finding that general form. Therefore, we have to be careful about symplifying going forward, unless the problem demands it to prevent hiccups like this from occuring again.\n",

Therefore, I want to try an include a problem in latex for each homework assignment, so I can get the latex language drilled in to my head as it will definetly help me in the long run.\n",

So for our first assignment, when we had to do some simple code in jupyter notebook, I got through the homework probably in about 15 minutes as taking machine learning drilled me through the basics of Jupyter notebook countless times. I became a good resource for it as one person onlky had use sage briefly in the past, and the other two had use jupyter in the past, but not to the extent that I had. So I taught them on how to import packages and using them for special functions, such as sin(x). Then an easy way of creating lists, applying a function to the whole list, and writing it as a for loop.\n",

None really knew how to approach it as they couldn't see the pattern as they, like me, had simplified as well. So I talked about the process I went through to find the general form and emphasized that simplifying isn't always the answer, despite how tempting it may be."
