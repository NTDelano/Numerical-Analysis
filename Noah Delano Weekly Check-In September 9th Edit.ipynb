If you look at the relative error, it is decreasing. This means that as n increases, the percent decrease from n! to the approximate is getting smaller as the approx compared to the true value are pretty close to each other in terms of percentage. Therefore, the approximation is better as n increases.\n",

Since last Thursday, there has been a lot going on in my personal life, which prevented me from doing any of the assigned homework. With everything going on, I was very quiet Friday until I got a major panic attack, which lead me leaving class early. I was fine, but took the weekend to recooperate and began catching up on Monday where I tried answering and questions people had about bounds, but me knowledge was still limited as I was still catching up. But by wednesday, I was asking plenty of questions, especially on the terminology of the bounds, as well as how to isolate bounds on sertain inequalties of x, so I am quite proud of that. For the future, I just got to be able to get more time in studying the topics as I definetly still feel a bit behind everyone in this topic. I have a fundamental understanding of it, but getting a better understanding of error bounds is what I intend to improve on in the next few days. Hopefully, I will catch up soon.\n",
