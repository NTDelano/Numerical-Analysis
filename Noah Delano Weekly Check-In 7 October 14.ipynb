    "So when reviewing the topics we learned this week, there was mainly one concept that didn't quite make sense, specifically how the functions for solving for splines are derived. I know there is a lot of work involved, but the jumps the book made were just too big for me to accept. Therefore, I wanted to go step-by-step through the concept of spline interpolation in order to help me understand it better and not just assume the functions given should automatically be accepted"

    "A natural cubic spline is the reault of spline interpolation in order to get an approximate function for a set of points, or rather a piecewise function of quadratic functions, such that $s(x)$ (our spline piecewise function) is a polynomial of degree 3 or lower on each interval of points $[x_{j-1},x_j$. Also, in order to maintain continuity and prevent a disjointed spline function, then for each interval in $s(x)$, $'s(x)$, and $s''(x)$ are continuous, and $s''(x_1)=s''(x_n)=0$ in order to help the rates of $s(x)$ from increasing or decreasing rapidly.\n",

    "For this week, we finally got to change groups, which was so nice as maybe my group the past few weeks weren't super compatable as it was quiet a lot. Friday was really no different as practically no one spoke as I believe we all understood it. I believe I asked the question towars what my two problems pertained to, but it wasn't really touched upon, so I spent my time on this assignment to explore it. But on Monday, I had a lot of fun with Michaela and Kimberly when discussing problems from the new chapter. Kimberly posed a question, which we spent the class time working on and discussing our confusion on it. "

    "I really want to conduct more effective group session times as I had so much fun on Monday as I didn't know how to solve it and due to the fact I was being sociable while working, it reminded how much I love school and how much I love working there as well. I want to try finding more example or challenge problems and post them for the group so we can really take the time to explore the concept we are learning about. Maybe I will show what I worked on this week and see if they can help me finish my proof so that I can finally rest easy over my work"
